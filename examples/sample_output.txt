You know, few years ago ALL wallets ensured you have backed up your seed phrase by default by utilizing things like   - Disabling copy+paste - Ensuring that you have to type the phrase again manually  It's just that people are too lazy so they complained and now most wallets don't do it immediately. But it's a mistake.  People should be nagged and nagged and nagged and educated until it gets into their stubborn brains that seed phrase = their money.  Not your keys, not your coins. Seed is "keys".
